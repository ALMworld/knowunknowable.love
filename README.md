###About the Project
**Divide to Divine** playfully reimagines the ancient wisdom of the I Ching, transforming it into a modern, interactive experience. Through symbolic divination, DAO interactions, and acts of goodwill, it invites users to explore how **division and love** shape both personal insight and collective destiny.

Originally created for the **SCROLL OPEN HACKATHON**, the project illustrates the concept of DUKI (/dju:ki/): Decentralized Universal Kindness Income — a vision where universal kindness becomes a fundamental economic marketing strategy.

Launching on the **Scroll** chain feels especially fitting: Scroll’s zero-knowledge foundation mirrors the spirit of divination — a hidden truth revealed in an irreversible yet mysterious way. Much like zero-knowledge proofs, divination offers glimpses without full disclosure, guiding seekers toward the **divine will**. In truth, no one can fully know it scientifically — and that mystery is part of the life journey.

### License
This package is open-source and distributed under the DUKI License. It follows a structure similar to the MIT License, with one key distinction: if your business entity generates net profits (not revenue) from using DUKI-licensed projects, you are required to donate 1% of your entity's profits to a cause benefiting the world, preferably with provable transparency using blockchain—thus truly putting DUKI into action. We also hope that the world can feel your universal kindness and echo it back.

### Contribution
We welcome contributions! If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request on our GitHub repository.

If you make a few contributions—such as managing localization for a language—we'll also add you as a contributor to the DAO using your provided EVM address. This will allow you to claim a share of the profits generated by the project.
